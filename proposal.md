### Summary:

Rudin et al proposed a massively parallel RL pipeline for training quadrupeds to walk in minutes. Although its fast training time is impressive, the agents tends to overfit to the specific training environment and cannot generalize to unseen disturbances. We propose to modify their pipeline by adding entropy regularization to solve that problem.

## Big picture 

### What is the overall problem that this and related research is trying to solve?

The large problem is to have a general robot learn robust skills faster, and with minimum human engineering effort.

### Why should people (everyone) care about the problem?

We want to have robots learn new skills with great robustness. Thus we can rely on them to perform

### What has been done so far to address this problem?



## Specific project scope

### What subset of the overall big picture problem are you addressing in particular?

### How does solving this subproblem lead towards solving the big picture problem?

### What is your specific approach to solving this subproblem?

### How can you be reasonably sure this approach will result in a solution?

### How will we know that this subproblem has been satisfactorily solved, using quantitative metrics?

## Broader impact
(even if someone doesn't care about the big picture problem that you started with, why should they still care about the specific work that you've produced?  Who else can use your processes and results, and how?)

### What is the value of your approach beyond this specific solution?



### What is the value of this solution beyond solely solving this subproblem and getting us closer to solving the big picture problem?
